# Call Drop Prediction

I've used MyCall dataset in this project. Based on the inputs given the user the **Call Drop Category** can be predicted using different algorithms. Algorithms are already trained and ready to use. In this project I've implemented: 


- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine 
- K-nearest neighbors
- Multi-layer Perceptron 



For the UI part I've used streamlit library.
